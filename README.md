Learning WP hierarchy by doing a simple portfolio WordPress page
This WordPress Theme is aiming to be a basic portfolio page (one day). 
Here, I'm playing around with WP functions and creating custom WP Portfolio Theme which can serve as a base for future projects. 
But that's not the Nr1 goal in this case. 
The key here is to get confident with developing WP Themes and have fun meanwhile.

So, watch me progressing!
